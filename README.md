Experimenting with a simple pure functional + virtual DOM web app.

This architecture style is described
[here](https://github.com/paldepind/functional-frontend-architecture).

It is also _fractal_, i.e. it supports components that handle their own internal state using the same architectural pattern, and publish relevant events to the parent component. The meaning of fractal in this context is borrowed from [this article](http://staltz.com/unidirectional-user-interface-architectures.html).

## Yocto
Demo applications rely on a minimal framework called **Yocto**, providing:
- The main functional update/render loop (~16 SLOC)
- A way to create components that use the same pattern as the main application (~17 SLOC)
- A time-travel debugger, accessible via the console (~26 SLOC)

[Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) is used as the Virtual DOM library.

The fact that such a powerful framework can be based on such few lines of code reveal the deep strength of this architectural style in particular, and of the pure functional approach in general.

## ToDo
- How to import ramda type definitions without bundling it?
	- Ask in SO => wait for answer
	- Open issue in @types/ramda => wait for answer
- Expand the CRUD demo:
	- Components
		- Form
			- Custom validation
		- Other input widgets, e.g. radios, checkboxes, etc.
		- Componentize CRUD table
	- Contact edit / delete buttons in table
	- Expand REST-dummy service
	- Loading progress indicator component
	- Popup component
	- Search filter
	- Route support
	- Test CSS animations
